# Berlin Bike Sharing

This Streamlit app lets users search for a bike-sharing station in Berlin and view real-time information such as:
- Number of available bikes 🚲
- Number of empty docking slots 🅿️
- Live map showing station location 📍

The data comes from the [CityBikes API](https://api.citybik.es/v2/) and uses the `nextbike-berlin` network.
